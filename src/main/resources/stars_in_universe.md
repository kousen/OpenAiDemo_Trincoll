The number of stars in the universe is estimated to be in the range of 70 billion trillion to 300 sextillion stars. Here are the specific estimates from different sources:

- **300 Sextillion Stars**: Based on the latest estimates, astronomers believe there could be 300 sextillion stars in the universe.
- **200 Billion Trillion Stars**: This estimate is also mentioned in various sources, equating to 200 sextillion stars.
- **70 Billion Trillion Stars**: Another estimate suggests that there are approximately 70 billion trillion stars in the observable universe.

These numbers are based on observations, galaxy counts, and assumptions about the distribution of stars within galaxies. The exact number is difficult to determine due to the vastness of the universe and the limitations of current telescopic technology.
